societi it should be realiz first that bond price are inher unstabl typic a bond s price move opposit to interest rate howev the percentag price chang is not strict proportion to the percentag rate chang rather the ratio of price chang to rate chang increas as the price move below par in other word the farther the price fall the faster it fall this price behavior is quit differ from stock where the real valu of corpor asset put a floor under the share price and so tend to brake a price fall former the instabl of bond was counteract by tax law thus an investor purchas a bond below par could look forward to receiv the differ between purchas price and par at matur when this gain the socal market discount was tax at a more favor capitalgain rate investor had an incent to purchas discount bond thus tax law put a prop under the bond market begin in tax law reclassifi market discount as ordinari incom not capit gain howev investor still had some opportun for capit gain in bond if they could accur predict the interest rate cycl thus the tax prop was not abolish by the tax law chang but the new tax law by rais the capitalgain rate take away this prop a new propos befor congress goe on to destabil the bond market further the law would requir the investor to accru the market discount over the life of the bond this repres an extens of the tax treatment former given onli to bond origin issu at a discount the effect is to collect a tax in the absenc of a cash incom sinc bond investor are concern with noth if not the time valu of money the law creat a power incent to avoid discount bond as a result the bond s price will have to fall even farther than former to attract buyer for investor concern with the purchas power of money the tax law provid a second incent to avoid discount bond by requir accrual taxat the govern is collect a tax in today s dollar on a benefit to be receiv onli in futur inflat dollar perhap as far as year henc clear this is a goug of the investor note that rise inflat and fall bond price usual go togeth so that this second effect will be ad to the first in short where tax law former mitig the instabl of the bond market it now amplifi that instabl the implic are profound onc investor realiz their bond portfolio are riskier they will doubtless demand a higher return the cost of borrow will go up for american busi the bond market

borrow cost will increas the cost of the nation debt and lead to deeper budget deficit the middl class will find mortgag cost higher despit these negat implic the govern will probabl receiv no real tax benefit from the new law this conclus follow from the abil of investor to shelter incom behind the amort of premium on bond purchas abov par consequ the revenu gain on discount bond will be more

suggest in a third of the case the studi found the aim was also to speed the patient s death we were not surpris that the physician and nurs work with these patient would like to allow the patient to peac depart onc it s been decid that further medic therapi would be of no benefit said dr william wilson a resid at the univers of california at san diego and one of the author of the studi howev he

the withdraw of life support the studi found littl evid that patient who were receiv drug to speed their death were die ani more quick than those who did not receiv the drug the most import thing about this studi is that it show that one should not be afraid to provid the sedat and analges requir for a patient to be comfort for fear that in do so they might hasten the patient s death dr wilson

stranglehold on the south that has seen the democrat win onli of the old confederaci state in one of the last three elect this year enough voter have come back to the democrat that virtual everi southern state is up for grab for the first time sinc the last democrat jimmi carter won the white hous in bush need all of the south presid bush is in enough troubl nation that win almost all the south this year would not guarante his reelect but fail to do it would almost certain guarante his defeat that explain whi gov bill clinton was campaign today in louisiana which has gone democrat onc for mr carter in sinc the elect of john f kennedi in now poll show the candid to be even match there the no strateg object for the republican has to be a recreat of an almost solid south said earl black a univers of south carolina polit scientist if they ca nt do it i do nt see how they can find enough state to win from to the south regular vote as a solid democrat bloc but by the earli s the

neck usual we re point down economi is no issu mr bush clear stand a chanc to win all the region with the except of arkansa and perhap tennesse that could salvag his campaign but there is a fear among some republican that his lag prospect nation could compound his problem in the south where the economi remain the domin issu and the old valueladen issu that onc domin elect seem to have lost their punch not that it is hard to find bush support in the south interview with two dozen white voter at shop mall mississippi turn up onli one solid for mr clinton and in alabama mani of those who have

abort defend homosexu may be ok for some peopl but not for me but here and across the south it is clear that the sour economi mr bush s polit weak the allsouthern democrat ticket and the way in which the polit arithmet of the south can work against the republican are imperil the republican base no way i d vote for bush all seven of the peopl congreg near a string of antiqu and curio shop next to

with women voter lisa keti a yearold lawyer from folsom la who vote for mr reagan and mr bush in said she support mr clinton larg becaus of the republican opposit to abort right like the rest of the nation mr bush is hurt most by the economi but in the south there is an ad kicker the republican domin of the last year has come in state where the democrat general domin at the state level and where republican still have to fight the imag of be the parti of the wealthi hurt econom natali davi a polit scienc professor at birmingham southern colleg said percent of the reagan democrat poll in alabama said they were wors off today than four year ago as against percent of all voter that pose a tough hurdl for ani presid but some analyst say mr bush unlik mr reagan may not be the kind of republican who can sell in the south dure hard time the rural and smalltown south is hurt econom and who do they see in there said kevin phillip a republican polit analyst do they see a middleclass nixon or reagan no they see mr pinstrip from kennebunkport and skull and bone who s the old republican bogeyman also hurt the republican is the degre to which econom issu are trump social one in this elect in the past valueladen issu play strongest in the south this year even though issu like mr clinton s draft histori probabl do more for the republican in the south than elsewher few voter seem to mention the draft as a defin issu even race the issu that in overt and subtl way help transform the south from solid democrat to solid republican seem to be off the tabl i think the rodney king thing probabl blew ani chanc that they would tri to make that an issu becaus sometim issu even in a sublimin and subtl way are too hot to handl said matt toweri a republican who is run unoppos for state repres in cobb counti outsid atlanta factor the black vote in fact if race has help creat the new republican south this year may show that it can work for the democrat as well despit the wellpublic squabbl between mr clinton and the rev jess jackson black seem solid and often enthusiast behind mr clinton and and his run mate senat al gore of tennesse who are both typic of the democrat moder who run well in the south in state like alabama mississippi south carolina and louisiana where black can make up more than percent of the elector a solid black vote for mr clinton mean mr bush need more than percent of the white vote to win to the extent mr perot is a factor he tend to help mr clinton in the south by draw white voter from mr bush if clinton and bush more or less divid the white vote the republican have no hope professor black said compound the republican weak mr clinton and mr gore have run close to a perfect race for the south blunt social issu like the death penalti and welfar and hit hard on econom one the key was nomin two moder southern and distanc themselv a bit from jess jackson and appeal to reagan democrat to come home said william barnard a histori professor at the univers of alabama it s work still the strength of the democrat this year is realli just enough to keep them in the game not insur victori some support of mr bush think the south is too conserv not to final drift back to the republican i know what the poll say but i think this will be like the atlanta brave game the other night said mr miller the car mechan it was hard to see how they were go to win but they did for now in addit to arkansa and tennesse the clinton campaign is given it best chanc in north carolina georgia and perhap louisiana the republican seem strongest in mississippi and south carolina and are certain to throw everyth they can at mustwin state like florida and texa the differ is the democrat would be thrill with a split of the south the republican need to come close to wine it all i think this is like where with the except of texa and florida where the republican won big most of these state were veri tight race professor black said i could easili see all of these state go either way i could see a sweep for clinton or a sweep for bush but i think it s more like at this point to be a sweep for clinton correct octob sunday a chart last sunday about the southern

possibl to imagin that instead of be the crimin she is made out to be ms nasrin repres howev imperfect the hope and aspir with which peopl welcom the end of a horribl genocid and the birth of a new

today mr gingrich said mr damato was just wrong i do nt know whi he is wander around say these thing mr gingrich said on the cbs news program face the nation on anoth talk show mr armey the hous republican leader was far harsher suggest a motiv for mr damato that the senat was tri to shore up his polit stand in new york where he face reelect in two year mr gingrich return to the talkshow

show mr dole trail presid clinton by wide margin it has been a season of discont for republican with the sprout of intraparti feud but unlik the disagr among republican over issu like the minimum wage and the gas tax the damatogingrich argument is over how mr dole should shape his case to be presid and how close he should be identifi with mr gingrich s aggress approach mr damato is a lead figur in the dole campaign and his critic reverber throughout republican circl his complaint that mr gingrich misread his mandat from the elect were explicit and frequent in new york on friday mr gingrich said i would simpli say to al damato that we favor balanc the feder budget so that our children are nt crush by debt i think percent of the american peopl favor that he said most peopl also endors the hous republican effort to enact death penalti law and tax cut mr armey speak on the nbc news program meet the press said mr damato s mama appar did nt teach him not to bite the hand that feed him he said

new york you could almost hear a collect gasp eman from the portrait of vener lawyer line the wall of the citi bar associ meet hall the other night when a speaker first utter the term superpred it has shock valu all right and it solv a littl puzzl for those new yorker wonder whi their governor want to get tougher on juvenil crime even though the headlin blare news of a persist drop crime rate here is one answer it is fear of the futur and of superpred a term in vogu among some criminologist who are predict a sharp increas in violent crime in the next few year as the number of teenag soar a tick time bomb a report by law enforc expert call the come popul jump a percent increas in to yearold male by a serious problem becaus the rate of violent crime among teenag has soar even as crime among adult has gone down so new york is get readi gov georg e pataki has made recommend for get tougher with young crimin as well as with adult and while it seem for a while that the propos could slip through without public debat they sure are get attent now as expert discuss them in tone close to apocalypt it s time we must prepar for the onslaught of juvenil violenc peter reinharz a lawyer for the citi said dure a panel discuss on a recent night at the citi bar associ in midtown cite the grow use of the term superpred that upset michael a corriero an act state suprem court justic presid over manhattan s youth part we are not deal with superpred he said we are deal with children and yearold children we can not demon and dehuman children not so said paul shechtman mr pataki s crimin justic director the governor s recommend make the round in albani includ increas mani minimum sentenc for juvenil offend transfer all yearold in detent center run by the state divis for youth to the regular prison system and sharpli increas sentenc for onceconvict youth who commit a serious feloni support say the propos would make the street safer by put violent youth behind bar oppon say imprison them with harden crimin would make them more violent you ca nt keep them in forev said philip b uninski senior attorney for statewid youth advocaci we know that the longer the time serv the more danger kid becom mr reinharz chief of the famili court divis of the citi s law depart said new york had littl choic let s put it this way he said after the panel discuss explain that he was speak for himself not as a citi offici there is anoth wave of juvenil crime come there are go to be a lot more peopl after the turn of the centuri in the teenag rang there are predict out there and the question is whether we are prepar if that happen if it doe not what have we lost a lot justic corriero and other critic argu do nt get me wrong he said i put yearold away for life but they re say we re expect this incred bubbl of juvenil violenc so let s build more jail let s increas sentenc if the assumpt is correct he continu the answer is not to increas sentenc the answer is to stop crime befor it happen but how prevent program have had deep budget cut and there is disagr on their effect the same for rehabilit up to percent of those who serv sentenc in youth divis detent center are rearrest and there is no proof that altern program for youth are more success than incarcer the grim pictur argu for more fundament chang than the governor has propos revamp the juvenilejustic law to address fundament flaw in in anoth toughoncrim era the legislatur mandat that all and yearold accus of serious crime have their case handl in adult court the system treat young offend accus of serious crime the same now make it imposs for judg to exercis discret and separ the more violent from those who might be redeem youth worker say that despit the depress statist young crimin can sometim be

and no march band the peopl of moscow tune their radio to wdev out of waterburi and everi year on the assumpt that the parad will go on the station broadcast about minut of march music start at am still after parad it is hard to be entir spontan on tuesday even moscow s fabl all ladi lawn chair drill team got togeth at jane christopherson s hous to drink wine and in flagrant violat of the rule

daughter is she plan to go to the parad if i do nt forget she said ice that has lain undisturb for hundr of thousand of year is yield clue that may foreshadow our own futur when earth s present warm trend give way to a new era of glaciat and cold dure the southern hemispher summer which conclud three month ago scientist from russia franc and the unit state drill deepli into the south polar ice sheet at russia s vostok station recov ice that form some year ago the precious core sampl of ice brought up from the depth cylindr sampl total near two mile in length includ the oldest ice scientist have ever been abl to analyz in recent year two major drill project in greenland have retriev ice at great depth but becaus snowfal in antarctica about an inch a year is onli onetenth as heavi as snowfal in greenland a given depth of compact snow in antarctica repres an age time as great as it would in greenland dr todd sower a pennsylvania state univers paleoclimatologist studi ice core sampl that have just arriv from vostok said that the hole had penetr layer of ice that go back in time through at least three and perhap four complet cycl of global glaciat glaciologist disagre as to how long a typic period of glaciat last but mani believ that it averag about year the longest continu climat record we ve got from ice core drill in greenland is year he said that did nt even get us back into the last interglaci period the vostok hole in antarctica went on to penetr an addit year take us through the last interglaci period the ice age that preced it and on into the next interglaci period dure the past summer we went deeper still at least doubl the climat record and perhap quadrupl it for at least three climat cycl glaciologist have not yet had time to determin the chronolog of cold and warm period repres by the latest vostok sampl dr sower said but they hope to present some detail result at a meet in england in august one more season of drill begin in the antarct spring next octob dr sower said should complet the hole and allow the team to cut through ice sediment to a depth repres year in the past a span encompass at least three period of global glaciat interglaci period particular the part of them punctuat by rapid chang in climat interest climatologist becaus of the light they may shed on the presentday interglaci period sever research project focus on an interglaci period call the younger drya from to year ago global climat condit then were unstabl return much of earth to nearglaci condit global warm in our own day could stimul climat instabl lead to a similar return to global chill and the growth of ice sheet some scientist believ the hole at vostok could be drill even deeper but russian radar crew have identifi a lake of liquid water about the size of lake ontario rest on bedrock beneath more than two mile of ice under vostok station the water in the lake kept liquid by geolog heat and pressur has probabl been trap for more than half a million year tap the lake with the present drill rig would contamin it bad with drill oil and other substanc which could damag ani live organ there the intern bodi that supervis all antarct research that might affect the contin s environ the scientif committe for antarct research known as scar is unlik to approv ani project that would contamin the lake the committe is expect to discuss the possibl at a meet in august at cambridg univers in england to sampl ice scientist use tubular drill that cut cylindr ice core as they descend the drill are lubric by diesel oil a typic ice core sampl is about feet long and mani of the core retriev from vostok and other hole are kept frozen at the nation ice core laboratori in denver to which they are transport by freezer van the exact dimens of vostok s subglaci lake have been reveal by radar and the vostok drill equip will get no closer than about feet to the top of the liquid water but even without go deeper scientist expect a bonanza of inform from the deep ice the deeper they drill the greater is the span of time repres by each foot of depth becaus of the compress of the layer under two mile of ice the hope is that sampl from vostok and other antarct site combin with analys of ice core from two complet drill project on the greenland ice sheet will enabl scientist to piec togeth the atmospher marin and continent chronolog and mechan lead to global climat chang includ those that might cast a new mantl of ice over much of the world s temper zone within the next centuri or so despit the immens stretch of geolog time repres by ice age there is grow evid that abrupt shortterm climat chang lead to worldwid flood or glaciat have been fair common in the past and that peopl aliv today might experi such a chang in their own lifetim such an interv might last onli a few hundr year like the littl ice age that chill europ begin around but it social effect might be sever in a paper publish last month by the journal natur dr paul a mayewski of the univers of new hampshir in durham and colleagu at the desert research institut in reno and the univers of new hampshir washington and miami present new evid that global climat chang could occur abrupt two year ago dr michael bender of the univers of rhode island and his colleagu report that an analysi of oxygen isotop in greenland ice sampl suggest that climat chang had sometim been abrupt at least in the northern hemispher but ice sampl from vostok in antarctica show no such rapid variat they found the new investig by dr mayewski s team focus not on vostok but on a coastal antarct site similar to the one in greenland tap by the greenland ice sheet project dr mayewski s team investig core sampl from the east antarct ice sheet at taylor dome near the ross sea an analysi show that dure a critic period of deglaci between and year ago the climat in the southern hemispher was appar just as abrupt variabl as it was in greenland chang can come swift and with devast result particular if a warm trend caus the collaps of a major ice sheet and rais the global sea level dr mayewski said in an interview that the onset of certain cold period not longterm ice age but relat short period within longer period of general warm has occur in less than year in both greenland and antarctica this suggest that such chang can be global in extent scientist tri to predict earth s futur climat look to the past for clue embed in ancient ice sea and land sediment tree ring fossil rat nest and mani other sourc but paleoclimatologist face problem in mesh the data they collect from differ sourc one goal of current research is to determin the phase of climat chang in the arctic and antarct when relat climat event occur at differ time in differ place infer can be drawn as to caus and effect and how chang propag around the world when certain climat chang are seen to occur at about the same time in wide separ place the possibl would includ someth extern to the earth dr mayewski said that would support the theori that shortterm chang in the output of the sun influenc earth s climat he said among the indic that paleoclimatologist measur are the ratio of two form of oxygen oxygen and oxygen it is believ that a high ratio of oxygen to oxygen in molecul of frozen water reflect a relat high atmospher temperatur at the time the ice form scientist also look for greenhous gase especi carbon dioxid and methan such gase absorb solar radiat but block the loss of heat by the atmospher two import indic of ancient windcircul pattern are calcium and sodium the calcium in ice core come almost entir from air that has pass over continent land mass while sodium come almost exclus from air mix with sea spray other ion electr charg atom or molecul also help scientist reconstruct atmospher circul pattern scientist are also measur the pressur of trap air within ice bubbl by combin this inform with temperatur estim they believ they can use the bubbl as miniatur altimet to gaug the height abov sea level of the ice sheet at various time in the past dr mayewski note that the most recent rapidchang event the onset of the socal littl ice age occur about ad that event end between and but the circul pattern it initi may still be in effect he believ the littl ice age may still be go on dr mayewski said although it goe through up and down it may last for anoth few hundr year to the extent that human activ may tend to warm earth s atmospher dr mayewski believ the warm could conflict with natur circul pattern induc by the littl ice age cool the result could be a greater number of violent storm and an increas frequenc of el nino oscil the period appear of a vast pool of warm water in the pacif ocean which strong influenc climat evid accumul dure the last few year suggest that this is actual happen dr mayewski said when i start do research in antarctica in the s we assum that the antarct ice sheet was a giant sluggish beast that domin it own climat rather than be influenc by shortterm chang in global climat now we re see that at least the edg of the ice sheet are much more sensit to climat chang than we knew the ice is tell us that climat can radic chang within the span of a singl human life that s someth to think about a day after a bonecrush brawl between rival retinu and angri fan who began land blow onc the profession fighter had

the first yanke to pitch in an interleagu skirmish when new york oppos the florida marlin in miami tonight but if you listen to cone discuss the event he sound more like a public relat director for the virtu of the american leagu against the nation leagu than a pitcher in a histor game over and over yesterday cone repeat his sermon about the ting feel he expect to experi and expect other to feel now that club from basebal s opposit leagu are play game befor the world seri for the first time cone sound like a super flak who is a super fan i think the fan are go to make it special said cone you re go to have a lot of electr in the stand the fan are go to be into it to me fan can dictat the atmospher they can make it a playofftyp atmospher they can pump up player not everi player share cone s sentiment it s just anoth game said mariano rivera it doe nt matter an unfaz cecil fielder ad i m not overjoy about it it s on the schedul so you go play but while sever of cone s teammat call the journey to pro player stadium just anoth trip in a long season the pitcher insist there was someth import about tonight s contest and someth extraordinari about the threegam seri with the met that begin monday night at yanke stadium cone claim fan will love the new matchup and he made an astound refer to fan in a minut interview such lavish attent to fan has not been voic sinc an overzeal yearold poke his glove over the rightfield fenc for a huge impact on last year s american leagu championship seri there s an element of excit in the air said cone who will oppos al leiter a former yanke i think the fan are into this experi i think the excit will be up i think the attend will be up cone has that right for all three game in miami this weekend and all three at yanke stadium next week are sold out the marlin have been averag fan a game but the interleagu contest will averag an inflat that was sure influenc by the yanke have train in nearbi fort lauderdal fla from to the yanke

tangl with the met in the seri that georg steinbrenn and steinbrenn alon probabl consid the most pivot of the season they must tussl with florida the marlin who are in second place in the nation leagu east have a better record than the defend world seri champion yanke who are second in the american leagu east but the record are not relev there are yanke fan everywher we go said cone you know there will be a lot of transplant new yorker there cone is the perfect pitcher in this spot becaus he has a nation leagu background from six year with the met and becaus attentiongrab game never bother him but it might bother him to bat in a nation leagu park the last time he did that in a regularseason game was aug cone who had hit in atbat averag for the met is not predict miracl the most import thing is get down a bunt cone said the chanc of our pitcher get a hit is pretti remot there will be no design hitter in the seri so manag joe torr has the ticklish choic of pick between fielder and tino martinez at first base sinc leiter is the onli lefthand start for florida the righthand fielder for off leiter might start over martinez for tonight i m not a fan of this said torr but i think it s go

will need one million new teacher over the next five year of those about will be need in the poorest urban and rural school the administr say the hope is that the new program will help train percent of this number some if it win congression approv the program will begin in the fall of the administr hope the effort will not onli increas the number of teacher in poor district but also improv their prepar under the plan grant would be offer through the depart of educ to postgradu educ train program to qualifi for the grant the train program would have to form partnership with poor school district either urban or rural to recruit and train teacher further they would have to identifi particular need that those teacher would fill like expertis in mathemat or english a teacher might also

have to increas their output for this the offici said not just maintain their output and shift their sourc of fund the teacher train program that receiv grant money would use it to help support student who promis to teach in poor district for three year averag tuition assist for a particip would probabl be about a year the offici said although some program might also offer transport or child

in come decad unless there are reduct in the emiss of greenhous gase like carbon dioxid which is produc by the burn of fossil fuel like coal and oil the model forecast a unanim one has been accept uncrit as gospel by some environmentalist and even some scientist and dismiss as all but worthless by some oppon of emiss reduct most expert take a middl stanc say that while the model are get more

place the pictur present by the comparison is clear in broadest term the comput got it right the world as a whole warm and the northern hemispher warm most but it also got a lot of the region detail wrong the comput said that eastern canada should have warm substanti for instanc but instead it cool a lot not a lot of stock should be place in a singl run of a singl model or even in mani run but mani run of mani model present the same pictur suggest by the map on dr sato s screen that the model show a general global fidel to realiti but also pervas region error they also continu to yield the same general conclus their much cruder predecessor first yield near two decad ago that a doubl of carbon dioxid concentr in the atmospher would rais the earth s averag surfac temperatur by three to eight degre fahrenheit the wide rang is a measur of the differ among model project and thus of the uncertainti inher in climat model a doubl of carbon dioxid concentr is expect late in the next

just over the horizon for one thing the atmospher s normal intern churn are to some extent unpredict some variat are never repeat exact as dr hansen put it the climat in ani year is like a snowflak no two are alik the same can be said for decad and centuri for anoth thing the atmospher is far too complex to be complet captur in ani comput program the essenc of model is to simplifi but to retain the

comput analysi scientist know for instanc that a doubl of carbon dioxid by itself would warm the earth s surfac by about two degre they also know that atmospher concentr of the gas are increas as a result of industri activ but simplic end there the warm touch off feedback process some of which increas the warm and some of which decreas it for instanc a warmer atmospher melt snow and sea ice both of which cool the planet by reflect sunlight less ice and snow mean further warm on the other hand warm also increas lowlevel cloud which cool the planet model is in larg measur an exercis in repres enough of these compet influenc faith enough to estim their net effect the most import of the feedback influenc perhap involv water vapor the most power greenhous gas of all an atmospher warm by carbon dioxid produc more vapor and this amplif is critic to the model forecast of futur warm a climat model is a comput program contain mathemat equat that express fundament law of atmospher physic these law govern the interlink work of the sun atmospher ocean land and other element of the climat system the various feedback influenc are also express mathemat the comput calcul the extent to which the basic physic law dictat chang in thing like temperatur and precipit over time and under differ condit for instanc model can introduc ani sort of forc influenc they want increas greenhous gase for instanc to see what would happen over decad and centuri one big limit of the model in predict the climat decad ahead is that despit the grow speed of comput they are unabl to calcul climat chang everywher in the atmospher instead they make the calcul onli at wide separ point the point form a threedimension grid typic rise or mile abov the earth a typic space between grid point is about mile horizont and less than half a mile vertic this resolut as scientist call it is about twice as fine as a decad ago but it still miss mani process that happen between grid point cloud format for exampl so model approxim these factor as best they can coars resolut is also the major reason whi the model are not veri good at simul climat at the region scale they simpli miss too mani smallscal climat influenc like topographi veget and region atmospher churn some model have develop techniqu for overcom this for instanc they might model onli part of the oceanatmospher system use much more close space grid point to get a better fix on region chang that approach has been success employ for instanc in predict the come and go of el nino the vast pool of tropic pacif water that disrupt weather around the world in anoth techniqu model take the general result of a global climat model and use them to construct a second model of higher resolut for a limit region research at pennsylvania state univers have so far success use this nest techniqu to reproduc observ precipit pattern in the middl atlant region as comput becom more advanc the resolut of model continu to improv research at a number of feder laboratori are collabor in the develop of a nextgener model use sever comput oper in parallel the ocean part of the model has a horizont grid space of less than mile which research believ is necessari to repres finescal ocean eddi and current it is onli in the last few year that model have includ deepocean process which are critic to the climat system s function the ocean for instanc absorb both carbon dioxid and heat transport heat from one part of the planet to the other and provid moistur to the atmospher an even bigger limit of the model than coars resolut is the incomplet knowledg of the atmospher s function dr hansen say dr gate agre say how the natur world work that s alway go to be our problem still the model have been steadili incorpor more and more featur of the climat system one of the most import in term of model realism has been the effect of tini solid particl and liquid droplet suspend in the atmospher the modern economi produc a lot of these aerosol as they are call most notabl sulfur dioxid droplet emit by industri aerosol cool part of the planet by reflect sunlight befor this effect was includ in the model they consist produc more global warm than was be observ afterward the model represent and the observ agre more close with the aerosol effect factor in the intergovernment scienc panel estim that the averag global temperatur will rise by two to six degre in the next centuri with a best estim of about three and a half degre bar cut in greenhous emiss the warm will continu after that the panel say the biggest gap in knowledg mani scientist believ is that the net effect of cloud on the planet s temperatur is still unknown while lowlevel cloud reflect heat highlevel cloud trap it moreov expert do not fulli understand how water vapor behav when the atmospher warm the amount by which vapor amplifi the warm therefor remain uncertain dr lindzen has long maintain that the model simpli get the physic of the water vapor feedback wrong at least at high altitud the unit nation panel say the amplif clear take place at lower altitud but conced the uncertainti about higher altitud even if such uncertainti are somehow resolv model will never be sure that they have includ all the inform necessari for realism with ani model what you never know is what you have nt put in said dr jeremiah p ostrik of princeton univers who come at comput model from a differ perspect that of an astrophysicist who use model to studi the cosmos the best realiti check he said is to see how well you can match the real world by that standard on the plus side mainstream scientist say the model reproduc the main featur of presentday climat includ the season cycl the come and go of monsoon the season shift of major rain belt and storm track the averag daili temperatur cycl and mani largescal featur of ocean circul in the last two year dr gate said model have for the first time reproduc the magnitud and frequenc of the climat system s natur intern fluctuat on sever time scale a number of them now have simul variabl that look realist he said but he said the unpredict inher in these fluctuat make it imposs to predict their time and alway will the model have also reproduc at least in general outlin the chang in global climat observ in the last centuri these includ not onli a general global warm of about one degre but also broad pattern of temperatur chang both geograph and vertic through the atmospher when the mount pinatubo volcano erupt in the philippin in send aloft a global haze of planetcool aerosol the goddard model predict that the cool would be about one degre at it low point and would last about two year that is what actual happen to mani expert that indic that the model faith reflect the climat system s sensit to heat and cool influenc from outsid whether they be aerosol or greenhous gase model have also simul the climat of the last ice age and come up with an averag global temperatur about seven degre lower than today s well within the cold period s actual temperatur rang but the model do not alway match realiti this well one major shortcom for instanc is that the global model fail to simul accur the major temperatur swing associ with el nino and there is that biggest defici of all the failur to predict climat chang accur on a region scale in sum the model are still cloudi crystal ball but they are get clearer and they offer some answer despit all the uncertainti i think you can make use estim of climat chang use the model said dr andrew p ingersol a planetari scientist at the california institut of technolog who employ them to investig the climat of other planet you just have to be awar of the uncertainti he said it s just like ani other scientif process warm world this

director of bioethic at the univers of pennsylvania and one of the studi s most vocifer oppon it is a phoni surgic oper you could wind up with a hole in your head for noth the placebo effect is well known in medic research and expert say it is particular power with a dramat intervent like surgeri that has pose a problem for dr freed and other research who have perform fetal cell transplant over the past decad with privat money although some of those patient got better scientist could not be certain if the fetal cell were respons or if they improv simpli becaus they knew they had been treat to get a true measur of success they had to compar peopl who got the cell with peopl who thought they had said dr michael d walker of the nation institut of neurolog disord and stroke which paid for dr freed s million studi if we are go to end up treat thousand of patient this way in the futur dr walker said we jolli well better know whether it is effect it is unlik that thousand of patient will

her good humor and bold assumpt of sexual author coupl with her raunchi aphor of wildean balanc transform her into one of the world s biggest boxoffic attract she was also the reason hollywood overhaul the product code the apparatus by which the industri censor it own materi in this way to combat the new licenti repres by littl mae her first three movi night after night she done him wrong

is call for her mama such blind innoc the sequenc is priceless but it also has the effect of make mae west appear to be frosti and complet out of touch with her costar which she was mae was not a team player but then she knew enough to realiz that the charact she alway play superhook could nt stand too much realism when actual joy passion or even humili are evid the superhook appear ridicul like miss piggi in an otherwis convent adapt of littl women mae took top bill in my littl chickade but she wound up sandbag by field both dirti blond and the reviv of sex remind us of the genuin good humor

sextett mae s last movi which open in new york in when she was near the film is mae s equival to the biblic epic about salom in which norma desmond intend to make her return to the screen in sunset boulevard mae s film is a sex comedi base on a play she had written some year earlier about a worldfam movi star and the attempt of her former husband and lover to prevent her from consumm her sixth marriag i m embarrass to admit that at the time the film open i took a dim rather puritan view of it and of mae point to the age of the star and to the infirm she share with the product you did nt have to be a wit to find a few laugh at her expens now have seen sunset boulevard a year ago and much more recent dirti blond and sex i feel quit differ there is no desir to sit through sextett again

themselv or not at all they have given an ultimatum to chriscraft that come due next monday sell your share to viacom or buy out viacom chriscraft want to maintain the partnership to help absorb the financi loss that continu despit the network s improv prospect it has gone to court to stop the merger becaus it believ that if viacom acquir cbs upn would no longer receiv proper attent the legal point it is make is this viacom is violat a claus in the partnership agreement that chriscraft say forbid viacom from make a deal with ani compet network viacom s posit is that the merger is onli propos at this point not put into effect and therefor it never violat it noncompet deal if all that spin your head think about this the corpor struggl is over a fledgl network made up of most weaker station that has pile up loss of about million in the five year of it exist but one year of wrestl has done much to revers what had been look like a death spiral with a twohour block of the wwf lead the way everi thursday night upn is show the biggest rate gain of ani network of ani size this season more than percent over all but almost percent among male teenag the growth come on what upn execut conced is an exceed small base last year the network had a nielsen rate of about two million home this year it has a but with wrestl at least upn has prove it can play with the big boy last thursday for exampl the network finish just a fraction behind fox for the night in the nation rate and easili won the night outright among those male teenag that is signific becaus young male are a group avid

success can be sustain becaus the young male viewer it is reach now suppli much of the audienc for the station that make up the upn network he also said upn would tailor upcom program to young men but would not limit the appeal to them that was a mistak that the wb network has made he said in aim it show exclus at teenag girl we want to be male friend not male exclus he said and he intend to retain a skew toward minor viewer we re not tri to be a broadcast or a narrowcast mr valentin said we want to be a midcast he said he expect chriscraft to tri to retain it interest in upn but that may depend on whether a settlement with viacom can be reach or anoth corpor partner can be found chriscraft would not be anxious to swallow the network s continu loss alon other suitor may appear mr diller and his usa network have been mention in specul about upn s futur but for the moment chriscraft want the court to forc viacom to remain it tagteam partner tom wolzien a media analyst for sanford c bernstein said viacom and cbs would not allow the upn morass to stand in the way of their deal noth is more import to them to get the merger close with or without upn mr wolzien said they would prefer to do it with upn but if it has to go away it goe away mr valentin said the network had come too far now to be forc into oblivion a fate it might have face had upn not found it ident under ani scenario we re now too valuabl an asset to disappear mr valentin said the discuss was for just a moment onli about basketbal mere a recit of what coach mike jarvi saw as the littl weak in his team s game there had been laps after all and jarvi attribut almost all of st john s loss this season to be at it own hand our greatest weak is we go to intermiss befor it s intermiss he said everybodi get to the point that becaus of faith they think you re good enough to relax for a few minut and take a vacat other than that our enemi is someth we have no control over an injuri injuri is our onli enemi and the ncaa there is no such thing as singleminded at st john s right now not as it tri to simultan wind it way through the tricki turn of the nation tournament begin with it firstround game against northern arizona in tucson on thursday night and the even more peril terrain of a nation collegi athlet associ investig that has focus on the red storm s best player erick barkley jarvi face a bizarr confluenc of event he will think as much about how his team respond to pressur defens as to the pressur of scrutini he will remind his team about continu to play it quick workmanlik style it is when st john s abandon that style that the team falter there is no separ basketbal from the murki circumst of the investig now although jarvi conced that the trip west will do the team some good to get away from this mad jarvi will watch tape of the other team and plan what defens to use to counter a pointshoot machin that also featur a foot center in northern arizona but when st john s board a flight this morn for arizona jarvi will also tuck into his briefcas a plan for the worst case if the ncaa find caus to rule barkley inelig for a third time this season right in the middl of the tournament it s sick jarvi said it just seem to go against what the organ should be about you ve got to keep look straight ahead and you ca nt look over your shoulder if you keep look back they re go to catch you someon will beat you we ve got to continu to deal with the realiti of the whole thing you hope to god it doe nt happen but you prepar for the worst we ve been do that for month and we ll do it as long as erick barkley goe to school here but st john s has shown remark mental tough for the last few week bootsi thornton has even turn what is perceiv as one of st john s shortcom it lack of size into a decid advantag he figur that if st john s can play onli six or occasion seven deep it mean that at least three of the starter will be on the floor all the time so there will be no chang in pace the player are convinc as they have been sinc the ncaa began ask question that they can prevail and that barkley in particular can set asid his tumultu weekend to lead them to the final four we do nt even talk about it thornton said of the controversi we have no other choic it s all we can do to shut it out the game are a relief for me onc we re on the court we can straightup focus on someth i hope the worst has pass center anthoni glover concur although there is a note of resign in his approach toward the ncaa investig if they re go to do someth they re go to do someth glover said

duti that i did nt have the proper id to enter the us compound which clog the heart of the capit so i call the us armi offic i had an appoint with and he offer to drive out to escort me in to make certain he found me i ask the sergeant who was run the checkpoint to take the phone and tell the offic exact where we were stand sir the sergeant said we re on the enemi side of the juli bridg hmm i thought to myself the enemi side of the juli bridg he s refer to baghdad outsid the wall of the us compound i could nt blame the sergeant for have that impress the bad guy in iraq have been gain so much momentum in recent day with their attack on pipelin us forc and the un headquart that they are steadili erod the sens of partnership between us forc and the iraqi peopl the mount attack are forc us troop in iraq to crouch more and more behind their own barricad to mistrust more and more iraqi and to put up more and more roadblock there is now a huge cement wall be built around part of the us compound in central baghdad that is a carbon copi of the wall israel is build in the west bank the same is happen on the iraqi side the pentagon with it insist on do nationbuild in iraq on the cheap has been too slow in form a provision iraqi govern too slow in get the electr on too slow in turn secur over to iraqi as a result while most iraqi are happi to be rid of saddam too mani feel that their live are tangibl wors in everi other respect job electr roadblock becaus of the us presenc saddam was paranoid but he kept the street open you re close all the arteri muhammad kadhim a baghdad professor said to me everyon has advic now for the us bring in un peacekeep bring in the french they re all wrong there are onli two thing we need more american out back and more iraqi out front presid bush need to give the us administr paul bremer iii more resourc to get basic servic here run and iraqi in charg as fast as we can this is not germani america is much more radioact in this region we do nt have infinit time which is also whi we need iraqi out front fast they need to be seen to be solv their own problem they need to be man the checkpoint becaus onli they know who the good guy and bad guy are and they need to be increas run the show so attack on iraq s infrastructur are seen and understood as attack on iraqi not on us and most import we need them out front becaus the iraqi silent major is our onli potenti friend in this whole neighborhood everyon els want america to fail but we have not empow that iraqi silent major enough and it has been too timid and divid to step forward yet the iraqi peopl are the onli one in the area who have an interest in your success said masrour barzani the secur chief for the kurdistan democrat parti a real friend of america s but you have not allow that friendship to emerg it can onli emerg if america get the basic right water job and electr and let iraqi run thing faster let iraqi take the credit let them take the blame mr barzani said we need iraqi to face their own problem and each other and right now you re in the way i heard a similar messag just a few day ago from sergio vieira de mello the chief un offic in baghdad who was kill in yesterday s bomb we met over lebanes beer and pistachio at his hotel and he told me how much he believ that iraqi could build a differ iraq if they were given half a chanc like me he was a congenit optimist who believ in peopl s better angel his senseless death is heartbreak it s also a challeng whoever blew up the un offic in baghdad was tri to blow up iraq s futur yes america must work harder now and devolv more power to iraqi faster but when all is said and done onli iraqi can rescu this place onli they can show us whether the divers communiti that make up this nation can rule themselv and take on their evil angel within onli they can prove whether iraqi are a nation with a collect will to be free and unit onli they can realli tell us the true ident of the peopl on the other side of the juli bridg ope columnist we live in a theatric age in which stage director have assum an ever more promin place in the creativ process they mount product of classic in way the writer would never recogn they forc shape the write of new play they even creat their own play sometim releg text to a subsidiari posit as robert wilson has done this steadili evolv influenc has provok overwrought complaint in the theater world a world that veri much includ opera this summer alon whether it was mark wingdavey s product of shakespear s henri v in central park with all those chair or the vari approach in the kirov opera season at the metropolitan opera some peopl hate just about anyth they perceiv as untradit even dead peopl are get into the act as in the estat of the late philanthropist sybil harrington which recent su the metropolitan opera for spend her money on a telecast of a product of wagner s tristan und isold that her executor said was nt tradit enough for her dead tast the consid critic respons to all this is whoa nelli theater has alway been a collect collabor art over the centuri the relationship among the various creativ forc has constant chang what the balanc was in shakespear s time is utter differ from what it is today or is it one way to bridg a gulf of time and place is to ignor it by tri say to recreat just what shakespear s play might have look like year ago the rebuilt globe theater in london is an american vision sam wanamak realiz by a british artist director mark rylanc the perform there judg from a richard iii this summer with kathryn hunter in the titl role may not embodi everi singl specul as to what perform at the globe or the rose might precis have been like but they come pretti close and can be pretti wonder chang is neither good nor bad presum the best product of brandnew work have a decent chanc of reflect the creator intent although even here onli a minor laps of time can caus major problem as in the attempt of samuel beckett s estat to suppress stage that differ from his stage direct product of centuriesold work like henri v becom more problemat whatev the balanc of pedant reinstat and poetic evoc tradit is a slipperi word one could imagin a henri v set anywher from the globe to an east german public toilet i can assur you that there must have been one the met s vener version of wagner s ring belov by some as an insight into what wagner realli want look to me more like what vener donor might have seen in their childhood in the s will director can either enliven or distort enliven if they accept the gulf between a playwright s time and immedi intent on the one hand and the sensibl of today on the other and set up a critic dialogu between past and present text and audienc distort if they just lay a simplemind ideolog monolith interpret on a multifacet play georg bchner s woyzeck about and onli about the evil of money symbol by dollar as was recent done in germani the temptat to distort is particular power in a climat that discourag the new like commerci cautious broadway or the west end today or when the creator like so mani modernist compos have drift from the audienc easier to feed the theatric and operat maw by toss it proven hit but spice them up to slake the yearn for novelti bold or braindead direct has been more common on the contin of europ than in the more conserv worddriven theatric climat of the englishspeak world no matter what the nation of the director cf mr wilson and peter sellar in europ it sometim seem as if there are theater everi few mile and everyon who care has seen henri v a hundr time my own respons is to focus on the merit and demerit of whatev product i m see right now and to avoid the sweep pronunciamento of someon like michael feingold mr feingold inspir by henri v and the kirov visit recent unburden himself of link essay in two success villag voic decri contemporari stage direct under the black umbrella of postmodern he wrote visionari direct and the deflationari subvers kind form an unholi merger and the target of their takeov was the classic repertoir gosh with all due respect to dramaturgi i have never encount a theori of theater that could explain whi product in ani style work or not of cours there are witless arrog overthetop director just like there are bore playwright rant actor and notal celebr but some subvers product are brilliant unforgett like mr wilson s account of a dream play three year ago at the brooklyn academi mr wilson reveal facet of strindberg that strindberg himself could never have envisag make for a compel dialogu across time success or failur depend on particular not on generalist theori when the playwright rule in elizabethan theater the world was bequeath some great play in part becaus word are more durabl than the ephemera of theatric product but there are still great play be written today tom stoppard anyon just as compos manag to write great opera when singer rule the operat stage it s the shift creativ balanc that keep theater aliv deal with it theater bailey albert lee jr kane lodg though both side were pepper with difficult question at yesterday s argument in the california recal case those pose to the civil right group that seek to delay the elect were more concret and direct suggest that at least the more conserv judg on the judg panel are inclin to let the elect take place next month the question pose to the other side were often abstract and hypothet seem ask out of curios rather than practic necess even some of the civil right group more like alli

billion up percent from billion yen in the period a year earlier becaus of robust sale of the infin g and the altima sedan and the introduct of vehicl like the murano crossov sport util vehicl in segment where nissan did not compet befor oper profit was billion yen billion up percent from a year earlier the figur show that the compani remain one of the most profit of automak with an oper profit margin of percent we were abl to absorb all the negat impact of the advers chang in exchang rate and still meet the number said carlo ghosn chief execut of nissan the compani forecast net profit of billion yen for the fiscal year end march which would be an increas of percent from the year just end the rise profit show that nissan is build on a turnaround begun after the french automak renault bought a control stake in the japanes compani in and dispatch a team of execut led by mr ghosn to lead a rigor turnaround of the compani mr ghosn who has becom a corpor hero in japan announc a

turnaround plan five year ago renault now own percent of nissan in the first year of the turnaround nissan s profit growth was driven larg by cost cut as mr ghosn s team push supplier to lower price this time around howev the biggest contribut to profit growth was nissan s abil to sell more vehicl even as it reduc discount a sign that effort to spice up the nissan and infin line with bolder design are pay off the sporti infin g sedan and g coup have been hit with american car buyer and the curvi murano has been sell well in an area where nissan previous did not offer a vehicl the crossov

compani s forecast you can not expect that everi product is go to be a hit mr ghosn said he ad howev that he expect good surpris will more than offset bad surpris the strength of nissan s infin line made a big contribut to the compani s profit growth for the year just end while the luxuri line account for just percent of nissan s global sale volum it account for percent of revenu and percent of

basic educ the recommend was a major victori for the campaign for fiscal equiti the advocaci group that su the state a decad ago on behalf of the citi s public school student but there was no joy in the suburb though no decis has been made about where the extra billion would come from mani expert agre that a sizabl chunk of it would have to come from nassau and suffolk counti long island resid alreadi pay some of the highest properti tax in the countri and now anticip a statewid review of school aid polici some local offici and advoc are make the case that long island should not be subsid other part of the state i think that nassau counti is somehow get shortchang on school aid said howard weitzman the counti comptrol he said he had been studi nassau counti as well as suffolk and new york citi s northern suburb for a report that he plan to send in the next few day to local and state lawmak accord to the report nassau counti school district in spent an averag of per student with

from the state well abov the state averag percent mitchel h palli the vice presid for govern affair at the long island associ said long island resid had long been make up for shortfal in state aid to their own school by increas local tax but the citi has not been make up the differ he said and long island should not be penal for do what new york should have been do all along the inadequaci of the fund is not base on the fact that new york state doe not give them enough money he said it s base on the fact that new york citi doe nt give their own school enough money the long island associ calcul that if all the billion were financ by citi resid the percentag of incom that they would pay in local tax would end up onli slight greater than the percentag long island resid pay now citi offici want the state to pick up the cost of the panel s recommend argu that inadequ school financ is not the citi s fault it s not just that we educ percent of the kid and we onli get percent of the total dollar figur said eva moskowitz a councilwoman in manhattan we also have a student popul that has mani more educ need citi pupil are more like to live in poverti lack prekindergarten school or be learn

contribut percent and some like steven sander of manhattan the head of the state assembl s educ committe have said that percent is a reason compromis but edmund j mcmahon of the manhattan institut said that ultim ani solut would be cost to long island ani set of circumst that is put more fiscal pressur on the state of new york and even on the citi of new york ultim is bad news for long island said even if the state pay onli percent of the billion that still mean a year state layout of almost billion in one like scenario mr mcmahon said legisl would demand that their district proport of aid remain the same with new york citi receiv about a third of the state s aid to public school this would mean that the entir state aid budget would increas by around billion pay for that would requir tax increas mr mcmahon said and higher incom tax will hit hard on long island with it disproportion share of aboveaverag incom on the other hand the state might decid to rearrang the proport forc wealthier school district to make up for lost state aid with higher properti tax that would also affect long island resid whose properti valu are higher than the state averag anticip the panel s recommend the citizen budget commiss issu a report in novemb explor other option for financ like tax gambl receipt broaden the state sale tax to cover more good and servic and elimin wast but all these measur taken togeth would probabl not prevent some form of tax increas the report said a formula devis by the commiss found that if the entir billion were financ sole by an increas in the state sale tax the tax would jump to percent from the current percent if it were financ sole by an incom tax increas a famili with an incom of around would pay about more a year it s inevit go to involv

to work on legisl that would commit billion more annual to school statewid the financi discrep long island from district to district is whi mr brecher said it was imposs to make simpl conclus about the impact of the panel s recommend wealthi district like great neck can have high tax revenu per student without high tax rate becaus much of the properti in the district is so expens and there is a signific commerci base as a result great neck receiv onli percent of it revenu in state aid accord to a citizen budget commiss report for the school year poorer district with small commerci district like roosevelt are in a doubl bind with higherthanaverag tax rate but belowaverag tax revenu per student even though state aid made up percent of roosevelt s revenu the campaign for fiscal equiti said

primari one from a direct impact or a secondari one caus by materi eject from a larg primari impact if a lot of crater particular smaller one are count as primari but are in fact secondari an age estim can be inaccur a studi of the crater on jupit s ici moon europa suggest that secondari crater are more common than previous thought the analysi by edward b bierhaus of lockhe martin s space explor system divis and colleagu from the southwest research institut found that about percent of europa s small crater those less than about half a mile across are secondari the research measur more than crater from imag of europa and use softwar to studi their spatial distribut secondari crater tend to be in cluster but the research who report their find in natur conclud that even mani crater that appear random distribut are secondari a larg primari impact produc mani fragment that sail long and far becom quit separ spatial the studi suggest that use small crater to estim surfac age is a question proposit on europa and perhap elsewher in the solar system and becaus comet are thought to be the main sourc of impact on europa and other jovian moon the studi suggest that there have been

their breed territori in central europ and head southwest for spain and portug in the last few decad howev more and more of the bird have flown northwest to spend winter in the british isl the reason for this split and similar chang in migrat pattern among other bird are littl known a studi by stuart bearhop of queen s univers belfast and colleagu shed some light on the mechan at the breed ground

colleagu clip bird claw at eight breed site when they studi mate pattern among the identifi bird the data strong suggest that bird are pair up with bird from the same general area dr bearhop said they probabl do so becaus bird from britain arriv at the breed site about day befor those from iberia bird that migrat to more northern breed site were also shown to produc more offspr than those who flew farther south this might be due to sever factor dr bearhop said norther migrat have a shorter trip so they can save more energi for reproduct by arriv earlier they get the best breed site and briton tend to make life easi for migrat bird by put out feeder dr bearhop said the migratori shift probabl start with a few bird that went to britain return mate and produc more offspr which in turn went to

nyt as a teenag in quebec where his father was the montreal canadien team photograph martin brodeur grew up in the shadow of the montreal forum idol patrick roy after spend the past dozen season as the devil no goaltend brodeur who turn on saturday has been around long enough to have becom an idol in his own right just ask the carolina hurrican rooki goaltend cam ward who said dure a confer call this week that he idol brodeur as he was grow up in alberta i was shake my head when i heard that on tv brodeur said friday befor the devil travel to raleigh nc for game of their nhl eastern confer semifin seri against ward and the hurrican on saturday afternoon i said oh no brodeur said that he use to laugh at his teammat when peopl approach them and told them how much they worship them and now it s happen to me brodeur said but the guy are younger and they look up to the championship team when they grew up like i did when patrick was there and i was part of three of them should brodeur win a stanley cup championship this season it would tie the four that roy won with the canadien and the colorado avalanch by win their final game of the regular season the devil ralli to win the atlant divis and the third seed in the eastern confer carolina which won the southeast divis is seed second no team in the playoff is hotter than the devil who swept the ranger in the first round with brodeur lead the way the devil have won consecut game equal the secondlongest win streak in nhl histori should the devil win game and against the hurrican they would match the game in a row the pittsburgh penguin won in should the devil win game brodeur would move into sole possess of third place in career playoff victori behind onli roy and grant fuhr and it was roy s record for regularseason victori and playoff victori that brodeur said he would cherish most if he could break them he has regularseason victori and playoff victori win is the most import thing to me said brodeur who equal his career high with a leaguelead victori in the regular season goal against averag save percentag shutout they re great he said but at the end of the day if you do nt win these game your team doe nt have ani success so i think for goali you have to look at the win total to appreci what the guy has done and if you have a lot of playoff win then you have a good chanc of win a lot of stanley cup when brodeur hear his name mention in the same sentenc as roy he said it is mindboggl to him he was the goali for the montreal canadien brodeur said and as canadian it s a lot differ than the kid in america or even the fan where everybodi has my jersey now back when we grew up when he start in jersey were not a big thing for us we idol the montreal canadien and patrick roy was our guy he was a young guy come in have success in an allenglish world and i start to know what hockey was all about when i went into the locker room in montreal with my dad when we spoke english it was like what s go on here everybodi s french no when you re young and you ve never realli left home you do nt know how it realli work so for us it was a big deal that he was one of our becaus we feel we re a small group in canada as french peopl that have success in the big world the nhl that feel of kinship was whi brodeur said he idol roy becaus they share the same heritag brodeur said he did not feel it was necessari to honor roy who wore no by wear his number or by wear jersey like kid do now brodeur said for a quick remind of that all he has to do saturday is look toward the other creas where ward wear no just like brodeur hockey in the leastafford place in the countri to live measur by the percentag of incom devot to mortgag payment was salina calif the second was the santa cruzwatsonvill area of california the third santa rosapetaluma calif in fact california has the distinct of have the leastafford metropolitan area in the countri one would need to go all the way down to th place and across the countri to the new york region s northern suburb to find a noncalifornia metropolitan area on the leastafford list of much of california is pretti it has beach and the mountain and of cours the weather but whi are place like salina which is surround by agricultur top place like honolulu no and miami no on the outofreach list there is no one answer but demograph and public planner who studi such trend say that a confluenc of factor in california both artifici and natur have combin to creat a particular acut problem california has both polit and geograph constraint on build said dowel myer professor of polici plan and develop at the univers of southern california that drive up price and then it snowbal the geograph limit on develop land are the hill and the coast while the polit restrict are state and local regul that prevent build new home in respons to both environment and congest concern one of the key factor here is the basic law of suppli and demand said jame w hugh dean of the edward j bloustein school of plan and public polici at rutger univers california is in mark contrast to florida where you can expand without constraint it s more like the new york suburb where too mani dollar are chase too few home while mani state have regul on growth california is a leader dean hugh say california is also in the forefront of popul growth but it is not driven as might be expect by envious eastern and midwestern escap snowbound winter nor is it driven by longterm californian in fact census figur show that over the past decad more peopl have left california emigr to neighbor state like nevada and arizona and farther away to texa and florida than have move in from other part of the countri the popul increas is driven primarili by birth and foreign immigr accord to census statist from april to juli california experienc a net natur increas take into account birth and death of million peopl and an addit million move in from other countri while california s birth rate is not the highest in the nation utah s is it is near the top new york has the constraint but doe nt have the popul growth professor myer said florida has the popul growth but doe nt have the constraint while it is difficult to build new hous in california that is nt to say none are go up accord to the california associ of realtor there have been increas in the number of hous unit built over the past nine year from in to in that is substanti more than the low in when california was in the throe of a sever econom recess and onli unit were built but it s not as prolif as in when went up there are a number of reason for the restraint on home build includ the fact that mani desir area in the state are alreadi built out and the permit process is more complex and drawn out now than it was a few decad ago lesli appletonyoung chief economist for the realtor group said the state need about unit a year to meet hous demand we ve been below that everi year over the past year she said the high demand and low suppli creat a perfect breed ground for investor and specul which becam the last straw in drive hous price up said david seider chief economist for the nation associ of home builder anoth quintessenti california issu is proposit the measur that slash properti tax by more than percent and ignit a nation properti tax revolut the measur which was suppos to facilit home buy has backfir to some extent local govern prefer that land be use for retail rather than hous becaus they collect more from sale tax than from properti tax proposit is a big stop sign say no hous need said peter dreier professor of public polici at occident colleg in los angel and an author of place matter metropolit for the st centuri univers press of kansa everi municip is engag in a bid war for retail they re battl for walmart to keep the librari open it is unlik that will chang professor dreier and other say call proposit the third rail of govern it s untouch although it is no surpris that hous price have gone through the roof in place like los angel san diego and san francisco what is more unexpect is that lesspopular area away from the coast are also top the list of leastafford place to live there s a huge movement away from la counti and from san francisco and the great beneficiari is the inland empir in southern california and in sacramento and point east in northern california said william frey a demograph at the brook institut the migrat is happen both among highskil and middleclass resid as well as lowskil and lowerclass one so the cost of hous is explod even in area of the state that most peopl do not think of as tradit expens he said babi boomer are get older and move into the higherincom bracket and into the topdollar market professor myer said immigr have high ownership rate at the bottom of the market it s a recip for a bubbl these noncoast communiti are no longer simpli attach to establish citi but in mani case have becom job center in their own right ms appletonyoung said the inland empir made up of riversid and san bernardino counti has been in a year transit from a bedroom suburb to a metropolitan area she said peopl are now work where they live ms appletonyoung said it s not a commut area the san joaquin valley in central california on the other hand still has a way to go to attract an educ work forc and to creat a divers and thrive economi but ms appletonyoung said it appear to be follow in the footstep of the inland empir as we say job follow hous the final paradox in this state of paradox is that tradit mani californian are not homeown the state rank th behind onli new york and hawaii in term of homeownership and about percent below the nation averag but over the past sever year even as hous price have increas more peopl are buy home sale climb fair steadili from through with onli a slight downward blip in said the california realtor associ han johnson a demograph with the nonprofit public polici institut of california said it s counterintuit but appar typic those familiar with homepurchas trend say that peopl buy when the market is go up not when it is go down if hous are so cost how are peopl manag to make the leap and becom homeown in some case they use method of financ that were not previous avail mr johnson said instead of fixedr year mortgag they take for exampl variabler intereston loan which have lower month payment in mani case he said homeown are pay far more on mortgag than the percent of incom recommend by the depart of hous and urban develop a studi by the public polici institut of california found that percent of all household in california the most anywher exceed this recommend threshold in some case they re even pay more than half mr johnson said new homeown are buy smaller home or condominium accord to the studi onli percent of longterm homeown in california live in multifamili hous unit like condominium while percent of recent buyer do in some way it s good becaus peopl own a hous and have equiti he said in other way it s bad he explain becaus if interest rate go up there will be a larg increas in month rate if there s a bubbl that burst or slowli leak he ad overextend owner may not be abl to sell and recov enough to pay off the loan professor dreier of occident colleg said he also blame state govern and busi leader for fail to support the creation of moderatepr hous not just for lowincom resid but also for middleclass peopl like teacher and nurs who can not buy into the overh hous market when he was a citi offici in boston the state govern businessmen and banker understood that afford hous was part of a healthi work forc professor dreier said in california busi and the chamber of commerc have not embrac hous issu like they have embrac other issu such as health care we wo nt see the polit will to solv the hous crisi until the organ busi communiti weigh in and say it s unaccept the big question now is whether the hous market will deflat while the economi stay strong which would enabl more californian to buy the answer seem as elus as predict the next earthquak the sign point toward a slowdown interest rate are go up and investor and specul who drove up price by buy and sell hous seem to be pull back in hot market nation but everyon even those who studi the subject know it is danger to predict ask professor myer of usc who sold his hous in los angel last year i was convinc it was go to peak he said after i sold it rose anoth percent hekimian leon md on your birthday o

heard at georg washington s dinner tabl dure the revolutionari war it goe simpli confus to the british of cours we now love the british in fact we have for a long time but the toast that we seem to be make to ourselv these day is simpler on both side of the aisl confus to ourselv on the democrat and republicaninnameon side we have the idea of windfal profit tax on energi compani these would presum mandat a desir level of corpor profit in one sector on which we depend and how long do you think it would appli to onli one industri if profit exceed that level they would be tax as far as i can tell there is no plan to give a rebat to the compani if their profit have fallen below that desir level in other word the plan is to send this messag to energycompani investor includ retire and pension fund yes we are in a situat of oil and gas shortag yes we want you to risk billion of dollar explor for and produc and refin oil and process gas but if you succeed for ani reason and even if no pricefix is found we will punish you for it this is what i would call confus you usual get more of someth by reward peopl for do it or produc it not by punish them for do it or produc it yes the human instinct of envi demand that we get some lick in against peopl who are do well even if we are do onli slight less well ourselv but economi built on the polit of envi are rare success ask the cambodian or the chines or the russian befor they went capitalist on the right side of the aisl there is breathtak confus about supplysid econom treasuri secretari john w snow has been tour the money program on televis tout the effect of the bush tax cut on feder revenu explain as one might say that this prove that supplysid theori realli doe work and you realli can get someth for noth he is part right in the same sens that you could borrow a bit more than trillion to buy stock and then tell peopl you are worth trillion if you do nt count the money you owe suppli side has a genesi in respect that come larg from my idol the nobel laureat economist milton friedman of the univers of chicago professor friedman said that if we cut tax govern would be kept from be so big and intrus and such a threat to civil liberti that make sens if you have a govern of respons adult ala we do nt then along came anoth friend arthur laffer a likabl and intellig man who with no substanti backup at all in data that i am awar of said that if you cut tax on incom you would stimul so much econom activ that you would collect as much in tax as you did when rate were higher note that this was actual a suppos refin on keynesian econom which inde predict econom growth if you cut tax and ran a deficit becaus govern would spend at a higher rate than consum this is wild oversimplifi and i apolog for that john maynard keyn also did not have a lot of data for his theori but they appeal to presid franklin d roosevelt so they were tri on a tini scale dure the depress did they work they did not work in the depress probabl becaus the scale of the deficit was far too small but they work like gangbust in world war ii when feder deficit were run rough percent of gross nation product and the economi was explod with growth what we saw in the year of presid ronald reagan and now presid bush was not in ani sens a vindic of the genius professor friedman or the persuas and charm mr laffer cut tax has not produc the feder spend cut that professor friedman was hope for not even close feder spend as a percentag of gnp bare chang under presid reagan the gusher of incom tax receipt that was promis to shrink the deficit to as low or lower than the level befor the tax cut did nt happen either inde under my pal mr bush whom i still love and admir despit his human flaw govern spend has risen as incom tax receipt have fallen the miss respons adult again perhap five year into a recoveri incom tax receipt are still lower than they were in merri presid bill clinton s last year at the helm corpor profit receipt have risen we have deficit such as have never been dream of in the absenc of a world war with more than trillion ad to the total nation debt sinc and all that borrow and spend has work as keyn guess they might yes we do have a veri strong economi by mani metric ala not includ person hour incom but that s for anoth day we have full employ and stupend corpor profit we even have a labor shortag but this is not a redempt of suppli side theori which promis growth that was enough to caus tax receipt to rise it is a redempt of oldfashion keynesian as it turn out mr reagan and the current presid were and are the real keynesian discipl not fdr or ani other democrat the republican turn out to be the parti of keyn as presid richard m nixon long ago acknowledg when he famous declar in now i am a keynesian suppli side is fun in the same way it s fun to ration spend as if it were save and in the same way ani theori is fun when it say that the easier softer way is better than the hard way but it doe nt work or at least it has nt work yet tax and spend was the old way but peopl did not like to be tax the new way seem to be do nt tax but keep spend and thing will be fine would nt it be pretti

that lone male dolphin are keen interest in femal research nevertheless it s go too far to say that dolphin are dimwit yet this is the claim of paul manger a south african scientist who say that dolphin relat larg brain are due simpli to preponder of fatti glial cell these glia produc heat which allow the brain s neuron to do their job in the cold ocean base on this observ professor manger could nt resist specul that the intellig of dolphin and other cetacean like whale and porpois is vast overr he offer gem of insight such as that dolphin are too stupid to jump over a slight barrier as when they are trap in a tuna net wherea most other anim will even a goldfish will jump out of it bowl he note if we skip the technic such as that glial cell are not simpli insul that they add connect to the brain and that human too have mani more glial cell than neuron the question remain whi the prospect of anim intellig set off such controversi could it be that the huge size of the dolphin brain which exceed our by percent or more threaten the human ego are we to ignor the billion and billion of neuron that dolphin do possess the goldfish remark remind me of a common strategi of those who

between anim and human emot for that matter just say that anim can learn from each other and henc have rudimentari cultur or that they can be jealous or empath is taken by some as a person affront accus of anthropomorph will fli and we ll be urg to be parsimoni in our explan the messag is that anim are no human that much is obvious but it is equal true that human are anim is it so outlandish
